# Datalatte: Empowering Connections Through Personal Knowledge Graphs

Datalatte is a decentralized application (dApp) that enhances human connections by leveraging self-sovereign personal knowledge graphs. We enable individuals to own and utilize their personal data to create meaningful connections, starting with professional networking at conferences and events.

## What We Do

1. **Personal Knowledge Graphs:** Build your own knowledge graph from your data, such as social media profiles. This graph encapsulates your interests, preferences, and goalsâ€”all privately owned by you.

2. **Facilitate Connections:** Use your knowledge graph to receive personalized networking recommendations at events, helping you connect with the most relevant people efficiently.

3. **Automate Opportunities:** Our agents monitor your public posts to provide tailored contacts and opportunities for future events, ensuring you never miss key connections.

## How It Works

- **Data Reclamation:** Reclaim your data from platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn to build your knowledge graph in seconds.

- **Privacy and Ownership:** Your data is stored privately on our edge nodes via OriginTrail; you hold the keys.

- **Enhanced Networking:** Receive a list of relevant people to connect with at events based on mutual interests and aligned intentions.
